### Features
* Cross-platform using Java 8 and JavaFX.
* Add any number of videos, playlists, and channels into a single group that can be refreshed for new comments and videos.
* Sign into multiple YouTube accounts. Reply with any account signed in.
* Archive comments and video metadata.
* Search by name, text, likes, type, and more.
* Discover frequency in activity by week of published videos & comments and see the most active & liked commentors.
* Discover which videos have their comments disabled.
* Achieve similar abilities of the *Comments* section under *Community* for any and every channel.
* View and search offline, sans thumbnails, once a group has been archived. *Thumbnails are not saved locally!*

**Does not** download thumbnails until they are viewed to conserve bandwidth & disk usage. Video and profile thumbnails are cached temporarily when viewed. Profile thumbnails will only show for the video channel owner and those that appear in the top 25 *Most Active Viewers* and *Most Liked Viewers* in a group. Locally saving thumbnails wastes bandwidth & disk space.

### Creating a Group

In order to create a group, first you must search through YouTube as you would on the website using the *Search Youtube* tab at the top. Additional search by location can be done by changing the search type from *Normal* to *Location* left of the search box. Select the results and add them to an existing group or create a new one.

### Managing a Group

Managing a group of channels or videos is simple. Select a group from the item box and information will appear below. **Refresh** while on a selected group in order to download and store new videos, video metadata, and comments & replies on those videos.

Once a group has been refreshed, comments can be searched through in the *Search Comments* tab. Activity and information about the videos, comments, and commentors can be found while still in *Manage Groups*. Clicking **Load** in the *Overview* tab for comments (amount by week, most active views, most popular viewers, most common comments) or videos (amount by week, most popular, most disliked, most commented, comments disabled) will display relevant information.
